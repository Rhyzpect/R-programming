# R-programming
This repository is a compilation of my source code during my online study on coursera.  The intent of this repo is for the author (that is me) to have a secure site to keep her code.  Anyone who wishes to use the code should as the owner.  Keep in mind that if you intend to use the code for your project on coursera you will dishonor the oath you promise and though no one will find out, remember that God is watching you. Also remember that, taking this code means you won't learn anything and your certification won't mean something. What is important is that you learn. So make your own code.
